Social Experience
August 24, 2016
I want to share my social experience and learnings I've had over the summer.
I joined a dance team called AFX Koja Kitchen in UC Berkeley. Not knowing anyone, I went in as a clean slate and this was a perfect opportunity to experiment with any altered persona. Our team comprised of around 30 people, which is big enough to have different personalities but also small enough for me to get to know everyone.
