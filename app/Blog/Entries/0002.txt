"Oh the places you'll go."
This is one of the quotes that's spawned in my head multiple times recently. I thought that only those that were worthy would have opportunities to go the distance.
I want to be one of those. I try my best to achieve what I thought was only for the gifted but never do I really try my best. Never do I have the discipline to grind and perfect. Never do I spend my last minutes relaxing and feeling confident before the storm. I give myself too many breaks.
So here's my effort to break it. I don't expect it to be easy but I'm glad I can be optimistic. Cheers!
