Another Night Out
June 26, 2016
I went out to Alesso at 1015 Folsom on Friday and Ruby Skye for Project 46 on Saturday. Very enjoyable weekend to say the least. The most memorable moment was at Ruby when I was walking around, I locked eyes with this girl and I just had to ask her to dance. Some voice in my head told me, and she was very attractive, though she seemed kind of surprised when we did lock eyes. I think her friends thought I was a creeper because after dancing for a bit she got dragged away by them. I was separated from my friends at that point so they probably thought I was one of those hounds looking for fresh meat, but I was just enjoying my time dancing solo. Regardless I'm so pleased I am slowly overcoming my shyness and am learning from all these different social scenarios!
